Editing Modes
=============

CKEditor has three editing modes:

Article Editor mode (classic RTE)
   Editing is done within a fixed container.
   It is possible to customize how the editor behaves and how the content is styled.

   Used in the TYPO3 Backend.

Document Editor mode
   Editing is done as in Microsoft Word or Google Docs,
   where the document itself mimics a sheet of paper.
   The focus is on structuring content and not mainly on the layout itself.

Inline Editor mode
   All formatting styles are reused from the surrounding HTML and CSS styles,
   allowing for a seamless frontend editing.

   Used by TYPO3â€™s frontend_editing,
   which can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/frontend_editing>`__.
   frontend_editing is not covered in this document.

For a demonstration of all three modes,
see the `CKEditor demo <https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/demo/#article>`__.
