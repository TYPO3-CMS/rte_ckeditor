Installation
============

TYPO3 v9 and higher
===================

For installations since TYPO3 version 9 LTS, `rte_ckeditor` is activated by
default and ships with a default configuration for editors.

If you installed TYPO3 via composer with "subtree split", you must install
the extension, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer require typo3/cms-rte-ckeditor:~10.4

See :ref:`t3coreapi:extension-install` in TYPO3 Explained for more information
about installing extensions.
